Simple but convenient, and most importantly ipv6-aware, script to update your
Porkbun DNS.  Can get your IP from a network interface, Porkbun ping, or a
cmdline arg.  See `--help` for usage.

Untested, but I'm using it on my OpenWRT router and it's working so far.

Dependencies (apt, opkg or pip):

 - netifaces
 - requests

--Melissa
